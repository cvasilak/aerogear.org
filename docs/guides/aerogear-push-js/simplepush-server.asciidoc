The AeroGear SimplePush Server
------------------------------

The _AeroGear SimplePush server_ is a high performant implementation of the SimplePush protocol based on link:http://netty.io[Netty framework]. It can be used both as a standalone component, or be integrated into JBoss Application Server. In this guide we will describe how to run the standalone component, but you can have a look at this link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-simple-push-server/tree/master/wildfly-module[page] for details on how to integrate the server with JBoss.

=== Requirements

Please ensure that you use at least the minimum versions of the following components:

* Java SDK 1.7+
* Maven 3.0.5+

=== Setup

Download the server from the project's link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-simple-push-server[github page]. For the needs of the project, a custom Netty SockJS adapter implementation was written, but since it's not yet integrated in the Netty mainline (planned for next version) we need to install it manually for now. Simple execute the following in the command line to have the dependency installed in your local maven repository:

[source,c]
----
git clone https://github.com/danbev/netty/tree/sockjs
cd netty
mvn install -DskipTests=true
----

Once that is done, we are ready to install the server. On the command line execute:

[source,c]
----
cd aerogear-simple-push-server
mvn install
----

Once the installation finishes we are ready to run the server. On the command line:

[source,c]
----
cd server-netty
mvn exec:java
----

This will start the server and by default it will listen on localhost using port 7777. If you want to override those arguments have a look at the this page link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-simple-push-server/tree/master/server-netty[here] for more details.

On the console you should now see the following:

[source,c]
----
....
[INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.2:java (default-cli) @ aerogear-simplepush-server-netty ---
SockJS server with options {ACK_INTERVAL=300000, USERAGENT_REAPER_TIMEOUT=604800000, TLS=true, PORT=7777, HOST=localhost}
----

Now that we have the SimplePush server up and running, let's move to the link:../unified-push-server[next section] to configure the UnifiedPush server.

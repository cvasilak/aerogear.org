Configure the Build
-------------------

There are a few preparatory steps you must take to be able to get an application up and running. For this example, we will be using ``pusheedemoapp''.

Getting the Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clone the git repo of https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android[aerogear-android] and switch to the ``push'' branch
[source,c]
----
git clone https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android.git
git checkout push
----

Clone the git repo of https://github.com/secondsun/PushEEDemo.git[pusheedemo]
[source,c]
----
git clone https://github.com/secondsun/PushEEDemo
----

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PushEEDemo relies upon ``aerogear-android'', so we must enable the two to work in tandem on the build path. In Eclipse ADT, 
right click ``aerogear-android'', choose ``Properties'', then choose ``Android'', and check ``Is Library''.
Now, right click ``MainActivity'' of PushEEDemo, and choose ``Properties'' again. Click ``Java Build Path'', and check the 
box next to ``aerogear-android''. This will include the necessary resources needed for AeroGear.

Finally, we also need to add a few Android and Google resources to the build path. In the ``Java Build Path'' of PushEEDemo, 
choose ``Libraries'', and ``Add External JARs...'' We need to import android-support-v*.jar, where * denotes a version number.

*This JAR is located in $ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/support. If you do not have this in your SDK, use the SDK Manager to 
download it. Located under ``Extras'', install ``Android Support Library''.*

Depending upon your configuration, you may need to also reference the following external JARs (followed by location) in your *aerogear-android* project:

- Android Support Libraries: android-support-v*.jar ($ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/support/v*)
- Google Guava: https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/[guava.jar]
- Google GSon: https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/[gson-v-v-v.jar] (v is version)
- Google Play Services: google-play-services.jar ($ANDROID_HOME/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib/libs/)
